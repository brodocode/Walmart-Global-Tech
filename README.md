# 📊 Walmart Global Tech: ETL Data Pipeline Project

A hands-on data engineering and analytics project built using AstraDB, Python, and Jupyter Notebook. The goal of the project is to simulate an end-to-end **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow using sample Walmart datasets.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

* Extracting transactional data from CSV files
* Cleaning and transforming the data using Python and Pandas
* Loading the cleaned data into **Astra DB (Cassandra-based NoSQL database)**
* Querying the database using **CQL (Cassandra Query Language)**
* Visualizing data using Jupyter Notebook to derive meaningful insights

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

* **Python** – For scripting the ETL logic
* **Pandas** – For data wrangling
* **Jupyter Notebook** – For step-by-step execution and analysis
* **Astra DB** – Cloud-hosted NoSQL database
* **CQL** – To interact with the database
